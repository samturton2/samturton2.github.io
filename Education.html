<p><b>Final Project: 2:1</b><br>
<i>`Developing an affordable CO2 monitoring device for low-income country anaesthesia patientsâ€™</i>

Capnographs are essential for safe anaesthetic procedures but are currently highly expensive and have a lot of extra features. Our project was based around making a stripped down capnograph using an Infrared Emitter and a thermopile to plot the relative CO2 concentration in the intubation tube. A number of problems were faced when finding materials with an appropriate absorption spectra, comparing the IR emissions to blackbody spectrum and preventing the detector from over heating, all solved root cause analysis and compartmentalising each of the problems. Autodesk fusion was used to design the appropriate 3D housing for the emitter, thermopile, and PCB. </p>
